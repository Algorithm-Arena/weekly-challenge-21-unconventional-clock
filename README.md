# Weekly Challenge #21 - Unconventional Clock

**For this challenge, you need to implement a program that tells time, in an unconventional way.** The very interesting thing about telling time is that there are so many ways to do it, there are the standard analog and digital clocks but also sundial using shadows, hourglass with sand... Can you come up with something clever?

### Winners:

The winner for $75 is @Nakatox! The idea of presenting the time in binary where each digit is an hourglass for its completion is mind bending ðŸ¤¯! https://github.com/Algorithm-Arena/weekly-challenge-21-unconventional-clock/issues/4

In second place with $50 is @morenicogs! What if you encoded the time in binary and use it to start a game of life sequence, well that turns out really pretty! https://github.com/Algorithm-Arena/weekly-challenge-21-unconventional-clock/issues/7

In third place for $25 is @PuttTim! If you are stranded in a middle of the ocean and want to get the time, this Morse Code clock is what you need! .---- ....- : .---- -.... : ..--- ---.. https://github.com/Algorithm-Arena/weekly-challenge-21-unconventional-clock/issues/6

Honorable mention for @nikpundik! This past/future clock concept for the minutes and the hours is very interesting. https://github.com/Algorithm-Arena/weekly-challenge-21-unconventional-clock/issues/3

Honorable mention for @Uzo2005! Marying a physial fan and a clock is such a clever concept, I'd love to see a real world one being built! https://github.com/Algorithm-Arena/weekly-challenge-21-unconventional-clock/issues/5

Honorable mention for @philip-edekobi! Really cool idea to roll dices to form the time you can read, there's even a nice animation! https://github.com/Algorithm-Arena/weekly-challenge-21-unconventional-clock/issues/2

Honorable mention for myself... When I told my wife about the challenge she mentioned that we should have a hunger clock until next meal... so I built one ðŸ¤¤! https://github.com/Algorithm-Arena/weekly-challenge-21-unconventional-clock/issues/1
