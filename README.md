# Weekly Challenge #21 - Unconventional Clock

**For this challenge, you need to implement a program that tells time, in an unconventional way.** The very interesting thing about telling time is that there are so many ways to do it, there are the standard analog and digital clocks but also sundial using shadows, hourglass with sand... Can you come up with something clever?
